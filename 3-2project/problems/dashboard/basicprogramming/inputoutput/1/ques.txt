In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the
 same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges.
This challenge requires you to print HELLO WORLD! on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout.

Note: You do not need to read any input in this challenge.
